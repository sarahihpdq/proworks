# ProWorks

ProWorks is a Python-based application that offers volume and sound management tools to enhance audio control capabilities on Windows systems. This program allows users to manage system volume, balance audio channels, and apply volume fading effects.

## Features

- **Volume Control**: Set, increase, or decrease the system volume.
- **Mute**: Instantly mute the system audio.
- **Fade Volume**: Gradually increase or decrease volume to a target level over a specified duration.
- **Channel Balancing**: Adjust the balance between left and right audio channels.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proworks.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd proworks
```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python proworks.py
```

The script will simulate volume control operations. In a real-world application, the methods would interface directly with the Windows API to control system audio.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
